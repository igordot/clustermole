Description: A typical computational pipeline to process single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data  involves clustering of cells. Assignment of cell type labels to those clusters is often a time-consuming process that involves manual inspection of the cluster marker genes complemented with a detailed literature search. This is especially challenging if you are not familiar with all the captured subpopulations or have unexpected contaminants. 'clustermole' provides a comprehensive meta collection of cell identity markers for thousands of human and mouse cell types sourced from a variety of databases as well as methods to query them.
