# clustermole: exploratory scRNA-seq cell type analysis

The clustermole R package (available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=clustermole)) provides methods to query cell identity markers sourced from a variety of databases.
It includes three primary features:

* a meta-database of human and mouse markers for thousands of cell types
* cell type prediction based on marker genes
* cell type prediction based on the full expression matrix

Check the [documentation website](https://igordot.github.io/clustermole/) for more information.
