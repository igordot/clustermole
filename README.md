# ClusterMole

> See, children, the misguided Mole.  
> He lives down in a deep, dark hole;  
> Sweetness, and light, and good fresh air  
> Are things for which he does not care.  
> He has not even that makeshift  
> Of feeble minds - the social gift.  
> But say not that he has no soul,  
> Lest haply we misjudge the Mole;  
> Nay, if we measure him by men,  
> No doubt he sits in his dark den  
> Instructing others blind as he  
> Exactly how the world should be.  
>
> -- Oliver Herford
